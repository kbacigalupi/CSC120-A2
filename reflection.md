What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It was difficult to find a place to start. I think it was hard to think about the classes abstractly. I wasn't sure which attributes or methods should belong to a computer versus the resale shop. It was also a bit confusing to look at the prompted questions OUTSIDE fo the constructor. Intuitively I thought all the attributes of each computer would be different, and have no attributes outside of the constructor, and I thought maybe I was missing something. I was also stuck on what the true final product was-I couldn't see the end goal. I think I was trying to think beyond changing the procedural code to object oriented towards making a store the user could interact with. This was overwhelming and got in the way of starting. 

The easiest place to start for me was to make a computer constructor. I used the exact same attributes in the procedural code. Once I had a computer class and had created a computer instance, it was easier to go through the procedural main code line by line/function by function and place the functions into either the shop or the computer. By the end, I had placed all of the functions in the resale shop class. As I thought about it, the shop owned the computers & it was the shop's job to update facts about the computer and keep track of the dictionary of computers. The only method I didn't have was a "change price" method. With computer being an object, all I had to call was computer.price to set a new price for the computer. It felt like there was not a more complicated method that I needed to place in computer. Still, I'm not sure if placing all the methods in the resale_shop was the right way to solve the problem.

I also wasn't sure if continuing to use a dictionary to store inventory in an object was the right decision. I felt like I was missing something (which I still might be). I think the fear of doing something "wrong" or not quite right was hard to get over. I would advise someone to jump into something and not be afraid to just start. Using the web resource I used (https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/#define-a-class-in-python) was also really helpful in terms of syntax and understanding.
